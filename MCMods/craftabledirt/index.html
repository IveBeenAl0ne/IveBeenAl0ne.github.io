    <p>So this is a shitpost mod I made because a friend made showed me a Nether Waste which, as far as I could find, did not contain any trees.</p>
    <p>I knew I needed to do something to make this playable, at least enough, to be able to have a wood alternative, and that is, Dirt.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you really wanna play this steaming pile, then you can download it <a href="craftabledirt-1.18.2-1.0.0-RC1.jar">here</a></p>
    <p>Bear in mind its not fully done, and its only for 1.18.2, but it's probably as done as it's going to get. If you wanna complain about it to me, then feel free to remake it, because I'm not.</p>
    <p>I recommend that you use Just Enough Items to get the recipes, but the basics are, do the same recipe you'd normally do to make sticks, just with dirt. </p>
    <p>Dirt sticks *should* be compatable with any mod that uses regular wooden sticks from vanilla minecraft, but dont take my word word for it as I haven't had a chance to try any other mods myself.</p>
