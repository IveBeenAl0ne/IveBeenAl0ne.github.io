    <p>This. This is the Pickle Cookie mod. <a href="picklecookies-1.18.2-1.0.1.jar"> Click here</a> to download it.</p>
    <p>The Pickle Cookies mod adds 2 new types of cookies to the game. You guessed it. Pickle Cookies.</p>
    <p>This release works with with 1.18.2 and 1.19.2, and honestly I'm not sure if it can run on 1.18.X or 1.19.X</p>
    <p>I recommend that you use Just Enough Items to get the recipes, but if you are <i>*that*</i> guy, here are the recipes. </p>
