<h1>How to Connect.</h1>

<p>
For simplicities sake, we use a program called "Radmin VPN" to connect and play.<br>
If you need a copy of it, you can get it at <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com">https://www.radmin-vpn.com.</a> <br>
The connection Information Is located in the Alone Dreamers Discord, <br>
assuming that you have the valid role for it. If not let us know.<br>
We do ask that you change your username in Radmin to the same as your Discord server name.<br>
<br>
If we can the servers we host will be under the "Local" tab in the game servers tab.
